        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta tossed with a garlic & lemon sauce. So simple, yet so delicious.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
            <li>1 head broccoli, cut into florets</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm olive oil in a small frying pan over low heat. Slowly cook garlic in oil until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Be very careful not to burn garlic. Stir in lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. About 5 minutes before pasta is done, drop broccoli into the pasta water. Continue to cook until pasta is cooked and broccoli is crisp-tender. Drain.</li>
            <li>Toss pasta, broccoli, and lemon sauce in a large bowl. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
